# CryptoTracker (Catalogue of Cryptocurrencies)

## Description

In this app, I managed to display the top 100 cryptocurrencies from the world sorted by their rank.
Also for convenient using it is possible to sort them by name and symbol using the searching form on the top navbar.
It has a page for analyzing information about each cryptocurrency.

## Built With

- React
- Redux
- JavaScript
- HTML5/CSS3
- Bootstrap
- [nomics](https://nomics.com/) api
